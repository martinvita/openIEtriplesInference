# Open IE-triples Inference
Open IE-triples Inference Corpus â€“ this corpus is related to LREC 2020 submission.

# Task definition

**Open IE-triples are textual triples in the form of (Subj, Rel, Obj).**

Given a pair of open IE-triples $p$ (premise triple) and $h$ (hypothesis triple), the task of *open IE-triples inference* is to classify the relation between the $p$ and $h$ as:

* *Entailment:* if the meaning of $h$ can be inferred from the meaning of $p$,
* *Neutral:* if the assertion expressed by $h$ might be true in case of assertion expressed $p$ is true and, moreover, the case of entailment does not hold,
* *Contradiction:* if the meaning of $h$ is contradictory to the meaning of $p$.

*Presented corpus was obtained by transformation process from SNLI and MultiNLI corpora (sentence pairs ID to SNLI and MultiNLI are provided).*
